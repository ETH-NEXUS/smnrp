## Getting started

SMNRP can be configured **using only environment variables**, what makes it ideal to implement into a configurable container. All possible configuration environment variables are described in this readme.

To integrate the SMNRP into your web application you just need to configure the environment variables (e.g. in the `.env` file).

Let's start with some examples.

## Examples

### Simple reverse proxy

To start with the most basic configuration to use `SMNRP` as a reverse proxy to a web application while requesting the certificates automatically from Let's Encrypt.

![Example1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ETH-NEXUS/smnrp/main/img/SMNRP_ex1.png)

```bash
SMNRP_DOMAINS=dom.org,www.dom.org
SMNRP_UPSTREAMS=api:5000
SMNRP_LOCATIONS=/api/!http://targets/api/,/api/static!/usr/share/static
```

In this example the domain names (`SMNRP_DOMAINS`) are provided. The first name in the comma separated list is used as the _common name (cn)_ in the certificate. The additional ones are configured as _Subject Alternative Names (SAN)_.

Only a single upstream (`SMNRP_UPSTREAMS`) needs to be configured. This _anonymous_ upstream can be referenced as `targets` in the locations (`SMNRP_LOCATIONS`) section.

The locations (`SMNRP_LOCATIONS`) can be configured in a comma separated list, where the parts are separated by `!`. In this example the

- `/api/` location will be _proxied_ (nginx: `proxy_pass`) to `http://targets/api/` and 
- `/api/static` will be _aliased_ (nginx: `alias`) to `/usr/share/static`.

### Simple load balancing

The following example shows the load balancing mode.

![Example2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ETH-NEXUS/smnrp/main/img/SMNRP_ex2.png)

```bash
SMNRP_DOMAINS=dom.org,www.dom.org
SMNRP_UPSTREAMS=srv1.dom.org:443,srv2.dom.org:443
SMNRP_LOCATIONS=/!https://targets/
```

In this scenario the certificates are requested from Let's Encrypt as in the first example. The traffic is then load balanced to two servers `srv1.dom.org` and `srv2.dom.org`. The load balancing is internally configured as:

```nginx
upstream targets {
  server srv1.dom.org:443 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=10s;
  keepalive 32;
  server srv2.dom.org:443 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=10s;
  keepalive 32;
}
```

The requests are equally distributed to the different targets. If one fails only the others are used. This mechanism can only be used for high availability scenarios **without** shared storage or shared state.

### Add virtual host support

![Example3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ETH-NEXUS/smnrp/main/img/SMNRP_ex3.png)

To enable virtual hosts you need to use the `|` separator in the config variables:

```bash
SMNRP_DOMAINS=dom.org,www.dom.org|otherdom.org
SMNRP_UPSTREAMS=|postman-echo.com:443
SMNRP_LOCATIONS=/!/web_root/dom.org/!t:a,/api/!https://postman-echo.com/get/|/api/!https://targets/get/
```

The configuration will take the order into account. First section is the first vhost (`dom.org`), second the second (`otherdom.org`) and so on. If you add vhost support for one config variable you need to add it for every other config variable as well except for `SMNRP_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` (this is a global setting).

In this example two vhosts are configured. **vhost1** does not have any upstream configured, where the upstream of **vhost2** is configured to be `postman-echo.com:443`. The first location for **vhost1** is configured as `/` to be _aliased_ (nginx: `alias`) to `/web_root/dom.org` as this is the directory inside SMNRP that is created to hold the files to be served for the vhost named `dom.org`. Additionally there are two flags configured for this location `t` and `a`. Those are described in details under the [Flags](#flags) section.

- The `/api/` location is _proxied_ (nginx: `proxy_pass`) to `https://postman-echo.com/get/`.
- The second vhost only _proxies_ the `/api/` location to `https://targets/get/`, what is basically the same as in vhost1 because the _upstream_ of vhost 2.

## Configuration

### `SMNRP_DOMAINS`

(required) Define a _comma separated list_ of domains you want to have included in the https certificate. The fist entry is used as the _common name (cn)_ and the domain name in general, the subsequent names are used as _Subject Alternative Names (SAN)_.
If virtual hosts are configured the first entry is used as the folder name in the `/web_root/<fist entry>` directory.

### `SMNRP_UPSTREAMS`

(optional) Define the upstream servers in a _comma separated list_. Unnamed upstreams can be referenced in the `SMNRP_LOCATIONS` as `targets`. You can also name targets by prefixing them with `target_name!`. If you use named targets you can reference them in `SMNRP_LOCATIONS` by its `target_name`. If this setting is not given the `/web_root` or `/web_root/<vhost>` is served.

```bash
SMNRP_UPSTREAMS=api:5000,notebook!notebook:8888
                ^^^      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                |        |
                |        + named target (referenced by 'notebook')
                + unnamed target (referenced by 'targets')
```

### `SMNRP_LOCATIONS`

(optional) Define additional locations you want to support. This is essential if you use `SMNRP` as a simple proxy for your web application. The definitions are _comma separated_ and consists of two mandatory and an optional part separated by `!`.

```bash
SMNRP_LOCATIONS=path!alias|proxy_url[!flags]
```

The `path` is the url location that should be directed. A `path` need to be configured as the tail of the uri (e.g. `/api/`).

The `alias` is a local directory inside the SMNRP container, normally bind mounted. An `alias` need to be configured as a path (e.g. `/usr/share/static` or `/web_root/<vhost>`).

The `proxy_url` defines a target outside of the SMNRP context. It could be an external web application or another container. A `proxy_url` need to be configured as a url (e.g. `https://target_name/api/` where `target_name` of the unnamed upstreams is `targets`).

Additionally, flags can be configured using a `:` separated string.

The three parts are separated by a `!`.

#### Flags

- **t**:  Adds a `try_files` clause to an alias location. This must be used if the files in the target need to be served.
- **a**:  Adds a `auth_basic` clause to the location so that only `SMNRP_USERS` have access to it. `SMNRP_USERS` must be configured in order to make this working.
- **c**:  Sets the headers to disables the browser cache.
- **i**:  Restricts access to the location to requests from the ETHZ network.
- **r**:  Returns a _permanent redirect_ (HTTP Status Code: 301) to the `alias` or `proxy_url`. This flag can not be mixed with other flags.
- **h**:  Sends the `$http_host` instead of `$host` as `Host` and `X-Forwarded-Host` proxy headers.

#### Example

```bash
SMNRP_LOCATIONS=/!/web_root/dom.org/!t:a,/api/!https://postman-echo.com/get/,/redirect/!/new-destination/!r
```

This example

- _aliases_ (nginx: `alias`) the `/` path to `/web_root/dom.org/`, 
- adds a `try_files` clause as well as a `auth_basic` clause to
the location section. 
- The `/api/` path is _proxied_ (nginx: `proxy_pass`) to `https://postman-echo.com/get/`.

#### Translation to nginx config

Basically the translation inside the nginx config is

- for an `alias`:

```nginx
location <path> {
  alias <alias>;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;      <--[Only if flag 't' is set]
}
```

- for a `proxy_url`:

```nginx
location <path> {
  proxy_pass <proxy_url>;
}
```

- for `auth_basic`, only if flag `a` is set:

```nginx
location <path> {
  auth_basic "Authorization Required";
  auth_basic_user_file <path_to_user_pw_list>;   <--[Derived from 'SMNRP_USERS']
}
```

- for IP restriction, only if flag `i` is set:

```nginx
location <path> {
  allow 127.0.0.1;                 <--[Localhost is always allowed]
  # ETH Zurich networks
  allow 82.130.64.0/18;
  allow 129.132.0.0/16;
  allow 148.187.14.0/24;
  allow 148.187.128.0/18;
  allow 148.187.192.0/19;
  allow 192.33.87.0/24;
  allow 192.33.88.0/21;
  allow 192.33.96.0/21;
  allow 192.33.104.0/22;
  allow 192.33.108.0/23;
  allow 192.33.110.0/24;
  allow 195.176.96.0/19;
  # Private networks
  allow 10.0.0.0/8;
  allow 172.16.0.0/12;
  allow 192.168.0.0/16;
  deny all;                        <--[All other IPs are denied]
}
```

- for _permanent redirect_, only if flag `r` is set:

```nginx
location <path> {
  return 301 <alias|proxy_url>;
}
```

If you want to redirect to the configured unnamed upstream(s) you can use `targets` as the server name.

If you want to redirect to another container you need to use the _service name_ of the particular application.

If you only want to proxy to the configured upstreams (`SMNRP_UPSTREAMS`), just leave `SMNRP_LOCATIONS` empty.

- for `$http_host` instead of `$host`, if `h` flag is set:

```nginx
location <path> {
  ...
  proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $http_host;
}
```

### `SMNRP_REQUEST_ON_BOOT`

If set to `true` SMNRP requests a new certificate from Let's Encrypt on every boot. Do not force this - it leads to problems getting a certificate because of too many requests. This is meant to be used in case of troubleshooting.

### `SMNRP_SELF_SIGNED`

If set to `true` SMNRP is generating self signed certificates instead of gathering it from Let's Encrypt.

### `SMNRP_SELF_SIGNED_RENEW`

If set to `true` SMNRP will regenerate the self signed certificate on each start - for debugging purposes.

### `SMNRP_OWN_CERT`

If set to `true` SMNRP will not create any certificate but it requires the following two files to be mapped into the container (i.e. as docker read-only volume):

- `/etc/letsencrypt/live/${domain}/fullchain.pem`
- `/etc/letsencrypt/live/${domain}/privkey.pem`

Here is an example:

```yaml
  ...
  ws:
    image: ethnexus/smnrp
    volumes:
      ...
      - /path/to/dom.org.fullchain.pem:/etc/letsencrypt/live/dom.org/fullchain.pem:ro
      - /path/to/dom.org.key.pem:/etc/letsencrypt/live/dom.org/privkey.pem:ro
```

> Replace the `${domain}` with the **first** domain name in `SMNRP_DOMAINS` comma separated list.

### `SMNRP_CSP`

You can define the `Content-Security-Policy` header. If this is not defined, the default (most secure) header is used:

```bash
default-src 'self' http: https: data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'
```

If you want to completely disable the `Content-Security-Policy` header set `SMNRP_CSP` to `none`:

```bash
SMNRP_CSP=none
```

It's often a good idea to set this to `none` to avoid unexpected access problems. It should only be set, if you need to extensively secure your web application.

### `SMNRP_DISABLE_OCSP_STAPLING`

If set to `true`, ocsp-stapling is disabled.

### `SMNRP_DISABLE_HTTPS`

If set to `true`, SMNRP will completely ignore https for communication and only listen on port 80 to serve the resources.

### `SMNRP_USE_BUYPASS`

If set to `true`, SMNRP uses Buypass certificate service in case of Let's Encrypt. This can be helpful, if there have been made too many requests to Let's Encrypt, disabling you from gathering new certificates.

```bash
SMNRP_USE_BUYPASS=false
```

### `SMNRP_USERS`

A comma separated list of `user:password` combinations to be allowed to do basic authentication on targets with the `a` flag.

### `SMNRP_WHITELIST`

A comma separated list of `networks` allow access to the location with the `w` flag.

```bash
SMNRP_USERS=admin:secret,user:pass
```

### `SMNRP_ENABLE_ANALYTICS`

If set to `true`, SMNRP is generating an analytics dashboard page based on [goaccess](https://goaccess.io/) at `analytics/dashboard.html`, default is `false`.

## Virtual host configuration

To enable virtual hosts you need to use the `|` separator in the config variables:

```bash
SMNRP_DOMAINS=dom.org,www.dom.org|otherdom.org
SMNRP_UPSTREAMS=|postman-echo.com:443
SMNRP_LOCATIONS=/!/web_root/localhost/!t:a,/api/!https://postman-echo.com/get/|/api/!https://targets/get/
SMNRP_SELF_SIGNED=true|true
SMNRP_USERS=admin:secret,user1:xzy|user2:pass
```

The configuration will take the order into account. First section is **vhost1**, the second is **vhost2** and so on. If you add vhost support for one config variable you **must add it for every other config variable** as well except for `SMNRP_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` which is a global setting.

A vhost configuration may contain all configuration entries as a configuration without vhost support. The configuration that will be taken into account is selected by the url that is accessing SMNRP (default vhost behavior).

## Apply custom configurations

`SMNRP` also loads `*.nginx` files in the directory `/etc/nginx/conf.d/custom/*.nginx`. You can bind mount or copy a local directory including your custom configs to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/custom/`.

```yaml
services:
  ws:
    image: ethnexus/smnrp
    volumes: 
      ...
      - ./custom/configs:/etc/nginx/conf.d/custom
```

## Integration into `docker-compose`

To integrate `SMNRP` into docker compose to setup a reverse proxy to the application, you need to add the following part into you `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  web_root:
  smnrp_data:
  log_data:
services:
  ws:
    image: ethnexus/smnrp
    volumes: 
      - web_root:/web_root
      - smnrp_data:/etc/letsencrypt
      - log_data:/var/log
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    env_file: .env
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - ui
      - api
  ui:
    ...
    volumes:
      - "web_root:/path/to/webapp"
    ...
  api:
    ...
```

Your web application files need to be generated into the docker volume `web_root` that needs to be mapped to `/web_root`. In case of vhosts it should be bind mounted to `/web_root/<vhost>`

Essential is the `smnrp_data` volume. It should **always** bind mounted to `/etc/letsencrypt`, otherwise SMNRP may create too many requests to Let's Encrypt and gets blocked for about 24h to request certificates. 
If you are using a local directory to bind mount `/etc/letsencrypt` (i.e. `./ssl:/etc/letsencrypt`) you must create the `ssl-dhparams.pem` in the root of this directory (i.e. `./ssl`) by using:

```bash
openssl dhparam -out ssl-dhparams.pem 4096 
```

### Integration into `docker-compose` while chaining `SMNRP` instances

In case you want to chaing `SMNRP` instances on the same host you need to configure the 

- `network_mode` to `host` and
- omit the `ports` configuration.

```yaml
volumes:
  smnrp_data:
  log_data:
services:
  ws:
    image: ethnexus/smnrp
    volumes: 
      - smnrp_data:/etc/letsencrypt
      - log_data:/var/log
    env_file: .env
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
```

## Maintenance mode

To enable the maintenance mode you need to touch the file `.maintenance` into the folder `/web_root` or `/web_root/<vhost>`. As long as the file exists `SMNRP` will return `503 Service unavailable` and displays a nice maintenance page.

### Change the maintenance page

To add a custom maintenance page you need to overwrite the file `/usr/share/nginx/html/error/maintenance.html`.

```yaml
...
  volumes:
    - ./my-maintenance.html:/usr/share/nginx/html/error/maintenance.html
```

### Script to enable, disable the maintenance mode

Here is a script that you could use to enable, disable the maintenance mode with one command (`maint.sh`):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

DC_EXEC="docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec ws"

if [[ "$1" == "on" ]]; then
    ${DC_EXEC} sh -c 'touch /web_root/.maintenance'
elif [[ "$1" == "off" ]]; then
    ${DC_EXEC} sh -c 'rm -f /web_root/.maintenance'
else
    echo "Please specify 'on' or 'off'"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Restrict access to a location to users

To enable basic authentication on selected locations you need to flag the location with the `a` flag and define the
users and passwords using the `SMNRP_USERS` environment variable.

```bash
SMNRP_LOCATIONS=/!/web_root/!t:a
SMNRP_USERS=admin:admin,user:pass
```

This example restricts the access to the

- `/` location to the users `admin` with the password `admin` and 
- the user `user` with the password `pass` using _Basic Authentication_.

## Restrict access to a location using a network whitelist

To enable network whitelisting to selected locations you need to flag the location with the `w` flag and define the
networks using the `SMNRP_WHITELIST` environment variable.

```bash
SMNRP_LOCATIONS=/!/web_root/!t:w
SMNRP_WHITELIST=127.0.0.1,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16
```

### Change the Authorization Required page

To add a custom _Authorization Required_ page you need to overwrite the file `/usr/share/nginx/html/error/auth_required.html`.

```yaml
...
  volumes:
    - ./my-auth_required.html:/usr/share/nginx/html/error/auth_required.html
```

## Detect and handle certificate renewals on host

`SMNRP` is adding a file called like the domain for which the certificate update happened into the directory `/signal`. You can bind mount this directory and run a cronjob on your host os to detect changes. This can be essential, for example if you want to restart a mail server after the Let's Encrypt certificate has been renewed. An example script could look like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

SIGNAL_DIR="/path/to/signal"
DOMAIN="domain.of.interest"

if [ -f "${SIGNAL_DIR}/${DOMAIN}" ]; then
    echo "##############"
    echo `date`
    rm -f "${SIGNAL_DIR}/${DOMAIN}"
    ### EXAMPLE to reload postfix
    postfix reload
    service dovecot reload
    ### you can add your own logic here
fi
```

The following entry can be added to the repository's owners crontab:

```crontab
* * * * * (sudo /path/to/scripts/certRenew.sh 2>&1) >> /path/to/logs/certRenew.log
```

## Reset smnrp

If you went into troubles because of too many different configuration changes, you may want to reset smnrp:

```bash
docker exec <smnrp-container> /smnrp_reset
docker restart <smnrp-container>
```

This will basically remove already downloaded certificates and forces `SMNRP` to request a new certificate after the container restart.

## Configure hardening parameters

ℹ️ The default values are the most secure ones.

### `SMNRP_CLIENT_MAX_BODY_SIZE`

Set the `client_max_body_size`, default is `1m`. This must be set to support large file uploads through SMNRP.

```bash
SMNRP_CLIENT_MAX_BODY_SIZE=1m
```

### `SMNRP_SERVER_TOKENS`

Set the `server_tokens` parameter for this server, default is `off`.

```bash
SMNRP_SERVER_TOKENS=off
```

### `SMNRP_CLIENT_BODY_BUFFER_SIZE`

Set the `client_body_buffer_size` parameter for this server, default is `1k`. Nginx default would be `8k|16k`

```bash
SMNRP_CLIENT_BODY_BUFFER_SIZE=1k
```

### `SMNRP_LARGE_CLIENT_HEADER_BUFFERS`

Set the `large_client_header_buffers` parameter for this server, default is `2 1k`. Nginx default would be `4 8k`

```bash
SMNRP_LARGE_CLIENT_HEADER_BUFFERS=2 1k
```
